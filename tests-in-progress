* Events that are over are not shown
* As a user, I can visit your API at `/api/events` and retrieve an object
  with key events containing all events in
  [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format. For example, the
  response may look akin to the following:
```javascript
  {
    events: [
      {
        id: 0,
        title: "...",
        location: "...",
        ...
      },
      {
        id: 1,
        title: "...",
        location: "...",
        ...
      },
    ]
  }
```
  * I can search for events by submitting a GET request to a URL like `/api/events?search=beach` and only receive back events that have ‘beach’ in the event title.
* As a user I can visit your page for creating new events at `/events/new`
    * The minute should only have 0, and 30 as selections. (At the hour and half hour).
    * The hour select should be in 24-hour time format: 0-23 are selectable.
    * The month select should have integer value attributes, numbered 0-11, and refer to months by their names: January, February, etc.
    * You should only be able to schedule events in 2015 and 2016
  * If the submitted form is valid, I am redirected to the detail page for that new event.
    This redirect is accomplished using a ["302" HTTP response](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_302).
    (See the documentation for the [Express.js response redirect method](http://expressjs.com/api.html#res.redirect))
